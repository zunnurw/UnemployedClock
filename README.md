## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

cd UnemployedClock

### Key Points:
- You can use **backticks** (```) for code blocks to make the commands stand out.
- Use **headers** (e.g., `##`, `###`) for section titles to organize the steps.
- Keep the text concise and use bullet points or numbered lists for clear instructions.

You can copy and paste this Markdown format into your `README.md` to make it look more structured and visually appealing on GitHub.
